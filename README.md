## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Learning to code and building things as I go.

What I'm Working On: Building a book app with AI chat features. Still figuring things out but making progress.

Current stack:

Python
Claude API
Some design work

Learning: 
React Native basics
Python and FastAPI
How to connect frontends and backends
Working with APIs
Design and UX

Background
I'm more of a vibe coder - I learn by building stuff and seeing what works. Still early in my coding journey but enjoying the process.
